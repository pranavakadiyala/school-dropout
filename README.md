### Data

The student data (hsls_17_students_pets_sr_v1_0) was obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics. The students dataset consists of 9th graders (at the time) who were selected in 2009. These selected students were followed throughout their time in high school and after. The data was collected when the students were selected in 2009, then for follow-ups in 2012, 2013 and 2016. High school and post-secondary school transcript data was also collected. The final year of available data is 2018. The students dataset is very large with 23503 rows, and 9614 columns. Each row represents one student. The ‘student_id’ column is unique in every row and could be considered the primary key of the dataset.
